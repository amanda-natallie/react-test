## Submitting your test

Be sure to fork this repository and push your changes to your fork. Your forked repository should be private!

When updating your repository, push your changes to a different branch (not master). When you're done, open a merge request (or pull request, if you are used to GitHub), so we can clearly see your changes.

Send us an email at `rh@educat.com.br` with your repository link and we will send our account so you can add us as a contributor (this way we can open your project).

Happy coding!
