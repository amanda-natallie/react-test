# FAQ UI

This SPA fetches frequently asked questions (FAQs) from an api and displays them to the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node
- Yarn


### Installing

First, clone the repository, then run

```
cd ui/
yarn install
```
to install React and other dependencies.


If you are also developing the api, you should create a `.env` file with the following content:
```
REACT_APP_API_HOST=<your-api-endpoint>
```
With this variable set, you can use the `API_HOST` const in `consts.js` when fetching data from your api.

## Running

```
yarn start
```
This will start the application on http://localhost:3000.

## What you should do
You should style the page according to [this wireframe](https://gitlab.com/r13/faq-test/wikis/Wireframes).

Remember to use React components to improve code readability and reusability.

When developing the form, you should use [controlled inputs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

#### If you are also developing the back-end
Instead of using hard-coded questions, fetch them from your API. When submitting the message form, make a POST request to the API endpoint you created for handling message creation. Remember to catch errors and display the right message to the user.
